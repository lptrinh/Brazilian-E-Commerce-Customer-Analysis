In this report:<br />
1. Conceptual design: I build Conceptual schema (EERD).<br />
2. Logical design: Data model mapping by draw.io to create database schema.<br />
3. Physical design: Specify internal storage structures, file organizations, indexes, access paths, and physical design parameters for the database files. In this step, I created Trigger to deal with semantic constraints which appeared in Conceptual design <br />
4. Write some functions, stored procedures <br />
5. Build an application by using XAMPP to connect with MySQL Server and Apache Web Server <br />
Through application, we can create user, login and logout, search patient information, add new patient, detail patient of a  doctor, payment report.
